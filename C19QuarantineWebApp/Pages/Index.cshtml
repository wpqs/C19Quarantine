        <p>This website aims to calculate your self-isolation period for Covid-19 as recommended by the UK National Health Service (NHS) for people who are not in a group considered at risk.
            The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/COVID-19_CAREKit_ENG.pdf" target="_blank"> US CDC booklet for Covid-19 Care</a>&nbsp;provides a form for recording your symptoms and
            temperature over a 14 day period. We recommend that you use this form or something similar to keep an accurate record of your health whilst in self-isolation.</p>
        <hr/>

        <h5>Notes</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Enter into <b>started self-isolation</b> the date and time in UK 12 hour format like 17-01-20 5:30 PM. This may be when your symptoms first started, or it may be when the first person in your household developed symptoms, or when you were told to self-isolate because of contact with someone with Covid-19.</li>
            <li>Enter into <b>symptoms first started</b> the date and time in UK 12 hour format like 17-01-20 5:30 PM. Leave it empty if you have not had any symptoms since starting self-isolation.</li>
            <li>The value we use for determining high temperature is <b>greater than or equal to 38.0 degrees celsius (oC)</b> as recorded by an oral thermometer. This value is given in the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/common-health-questions/accidents-first-aid-and-treatments/how-do-i-take-someones-temperature/" target="_blank">NHS First Aid Advice</a>&nbsp;and
                <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/COVID-19_CAREKit_ENG.pdf" target="_blank">US CDC guidance</a>. However, you should appreciate that it's not always easy to take a temperature accurately. Therefore if you feel hot or shivery you may have a high temperature even if a thermometer says your temperature is below 38 degrees celsius. In this case
                enter '39.0' as your temperature.
